      <description>Some updates in July 2018:
I was told by a 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa staff that the ‘must have passport with China stamp‘ rule stopped. You can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa now with a new passport. My advice: bring your old passport with China stamp anyway if you have one. Rules can change all the time.
For Indonesians, sadly, there is no news. Males can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa, females can not.</description>
