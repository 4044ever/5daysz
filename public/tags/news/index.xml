      <description>Sadly, a no update update. It’s September 2021 and the border is closed for most. This effects tourists, business visitors and most normal people, including all Hong Kong residents.
If you want to visit China you must apply a visa – even if you hold a valid multi-entry visa or an APEC card – a new visa must be applied. Depending where you enter you most likely get two week hotel quarantine.</description>

      <description>Corona Virus Update!
Since the Lowu/Luohu und Huanggang land borders are closed, all ferry services are stopped and only the Shenzhen Bay border is open (this border has no 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa office) there is currently no way to get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa. And even if, from Saturday Feb 7th onward Hong Kong imposes a mandatory 14 days quarantine for anybody that arrives from China. People that had been to Hubei province in the last 14 days will be banned from entering.</description>

      <description>Visitors from Indonesia are currently strangely treated when they apply for the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa – males can get the visa – females not!
Even for families that come in a group, husband and kids can get the visa – the wife not!
Some people suggested that this maybe related to Muslims (wearing headscarf or other Muslin dress) but this is not the case, it applies to all women from Indonesia.</description>

      <description>There is a new regulation:
No more 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa for first time China visitors!
If your passport has no China visa in it from a previous visit you will not get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa.
If you have a new passport with no China chops, but have been China before you must bring your old passport if you want to get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa.</description>
