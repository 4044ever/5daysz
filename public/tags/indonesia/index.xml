      <description>I am sorry to post this, but the policy for Indonesians changed again!
Currently you can not get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa! You must get the full China visa before you go to the border.</description>

      <description>Visitors from Indonesia are currently strangely treated when they apply for the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa – males can get the visa – females not!
Even for families that come in a group, husband and kids can get the visa – the wife not!
Some people suggested that this maybe related to Muslims (wearing headscarf or other Muslin dress) but this is not the case, it applies to all women from Indonesia.</description>

      <description>February 2017 update: Rules have changes again at the Shenzhen Border and Indonesians can get the #ShenzhenVisa (again).
This post below is now obsolete:
