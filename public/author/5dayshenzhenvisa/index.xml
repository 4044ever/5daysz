      <description>I am just now trying to add German as 2nd language to the website. I guess the website will have some chaos for a few days.
Das richtige deutsch wird noch ein paar Tage dauern. Ich bitte um Vergebung!</description>

      <description>My first blog entry, and a few updates from after I got online.
I recently tried Lok Ma Chau (Futian) and Shenzhen Bay border for the 5 Day Visa – both do not have it! Do not go there without visa!
Best way is either Lowu (Luohu) or Huanggang. Huanggang is open 24h, and the Port Visa Office is open 24h too. Huanggang is a bit harder to reach, must China buses cross there, or you can take Minibus #17 from Sheung Shui and get off at the ‘yellow bus station’, and take one of the yellow shuttles to the Hong Kong border (keep the ticket!</description>

      <description>Note: Since the end of March 2020 China has closed the all their borders for tourists. The 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa ist currently not available!  Huánggǎng (皇岗) is a very popular border for buses and cars, and it is open 24 hours round the clock in both directions. Most of the buses from Mongkok, Wanchai etc. cross here. And you can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen visa here too!
Procedure:
 Firstly get off the bus at Hong Kong immigration, with all your luggage Go through the Hong Kong passport exit check, find your bus after you exit the building It’s another 1Km bus ride to the China immigration building Get off the bus, follow the flow of the people to the immigration hall The passport check is on the right hand side – but since you have no visa you go left to the sign saying Port Visa  Get the 5 day Shenzhen visa form and fill it  Hand it to the counter, and wait Waiting time is usually just a few Minutes.</description>

      <description>Note: Since the end of March 2020 China has closed the all their borders for tourists. The 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa ist currently not available!  The easiest border to cross into Shenzhen is probably Lowu (Luōhú/罗湖/羅湖). It can easily reached by MTR (subway), in fact, Lowu can only be reached by MTR from Hong Kong. The border is open from 06:30 in the morning until midnight 00:00. The visa office is open 07:00 to 23:30 .</description>
