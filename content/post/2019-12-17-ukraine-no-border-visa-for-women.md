description: No More 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa For Female Visitors From Ukraine

---
An update on my [January 2019 post][1]. About: no-female-Ukraine-passport holders: Unfortunately this rule is still valid and enforced (December 2019). Ukrainian women can not get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa at the border. No border Visa for Ukrainian women! User Nicolas had bad luck:

>Ahhhh. So nice. Why I didn’t find your comment before? Arrived after 22h long trip to HKG airport, went to Huanggang border by shuttle bus, they deny my Ukrainian girlfriend the 5 day Shenzhen visa. Nice people! 
>
>Now sitting here 5+ hours at China Visa Application Center in Hong Kong and they say probably she won’t get the visa for another 3 days, this is awesome.
