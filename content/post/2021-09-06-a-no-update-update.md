description: Sadly, a No Update Update! September 2021 And the Hong Kong Shenzhen Border is Still Closed for Most. At Least Slowly Some Discussions Start....

Sadly, a no update update. It&#8217;s September 2021 and the border is closed for most. This effects tourists, business visitors and most _normal_ people, including all Hong Kong residents.

If you want to visit China you must apply a visa &#8211; even if you hold a valid multi-entry visa or an APEC card &#8211; a new visa must be applied. Depending where you enter you most likely get two week hotel quarantine. That mean two weeks you can&#8217;t leave your room!

In the latest news <a href="https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/179786/Hong-Kong-to-welcome-tourists-from-Shanghai-and-Guangdong:-CE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visitors from Shanghai and Guangdong</a> may soon be able to visit Hong Kong without quarantine. And there is some talk going on about <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1609321-20210906.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quarantine free visits from Hong Kong to Shenzhen</a>. 

This said, the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa seems far away though and is unlikely to happen to happen in 2021.
