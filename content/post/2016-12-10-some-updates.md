description: Recently I Tried Lok Ma Chau (Futian) and Shenzhen Bay Border for the 5 Day Visa - Both Do Not Have It! Do Not Go There Without Visa!

---
My first blog entry, and a few updates from after I got online.

I recently tried Lok Ma Chau (Futian) and Shenzhen Bay border for the 5 Day Visa &#8211; both do not have it! Do not go there without visa!

Best way is either Lowu (Luohu) or Huanggang. Huanggang is open 24h, and the Port Visa Office is open 24h too. Huanggang is a bit harder to reach, must China buses cross there, or you can take Minibus #17 from Sheung Shui and get off at the &#8216;yellow bus station&#8217;, and take one of the yellow shuttles to the Hong Kong border (keep the ticket!), and on the China border.
