Visitors from Indonesia are currently strangely treated when they apply for the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa &#8211; males can get the visa &#8211; **females not**!

Even for families that come in a group, husband and kids can get the visa &#8211; the wife not! 

Some people suggested that this maybe related to Muslims (wearing headscarf or other Muslin dress) but this is not the case, it applies to all women from Indonesia.
