There is a new regulation:

No more 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa for first time China visitors!

If your passport has **no** China visa in it from a previous visit you will **not** get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa.

If you have a new passport with no China chops, but have been China before you must bring your old passport if you want to get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa.
