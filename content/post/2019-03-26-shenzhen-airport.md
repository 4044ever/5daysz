According to this website below you can get a visa on arrival (VOA) at the Shenzhen airport:

<a href="http://www.gdcrj.com/zxdt/zxdt/201507/t20150730_31301.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.gdcrj.com/zxdt/zxdt/201507/t20150730_31301.htm</a>

There are some requirements according the airline visa database:

`Passengers with a normal passport arriving at Chongqing (CKG), Guangzhou (CAN), Guilin (KWL), Haikou (HAK), Kunming (KMG), Qingdao (TAO), Sanya (SYX), <strong>Shenzhen (SZX)</strong>, Weihai (WEH), Xi An (XIY) and Yantai (YNT) can obtain a visa on arrival if they have confirmation that a visa has been approved before departure and:<br />
- that a visa will be issued on arrival; and<br />
- passport contains at least 1 blank visa page for the sticker-type visa; and<br />
- a sponsor (approved by Chinese authorities) meets passenger on arrival.`

That means, you need pre-approval from the airline. It is not clear if that is the same visa as the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa.

If somebody knows more, please let me know.
