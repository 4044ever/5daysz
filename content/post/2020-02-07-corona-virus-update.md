Corona Virus Update!  
Since the Lowu/Luohu und Huanggang land borders are closed, all ferry services are stopped and only the Shenzhen Bay border is open (this border has **no** 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa office) there is currently no way to get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa. And even if, from Saturday Feb 7th onward Hong Kong imposes a mandatory 14 days quarantine for anybody that arrives from China. People that had been to Hubei province in the last 14 days will be banned from entering.
