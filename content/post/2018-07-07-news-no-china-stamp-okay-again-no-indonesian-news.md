description: No You Can Get The 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa With a Brand New Passport (But Bring Your Old One Anyway)
---
Some updates in July 2018:

I was told by a 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa staff that the &#8216;_must have passport with China stamp_&#8216; rule stopped. You can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa now with a new passport. My advice: bring your old passport with China stamp anyway if you have one. Rules can change all the time.

For Indonesians, sadly, there is no news. Males can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa, females can not.
