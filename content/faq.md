#### Can I use a new passport? {#0103}

Yes (again). Since July 2018 the _must-have-China-stamp_ changed again. You currently do not need to have any China visa stamp in your passport. If you have an old passport with a China stamp in it I suggest you bring it anyway just in case.

No! Since June 2017 there is a new regulation, you can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa only if you have been in China before. Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan does not count. Transit visa or a old 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa is accepted. If you have a China stamp in an old passport – bring it! That will be accepted.

#### What happen if entry gets refused? {#0108}

If entry gets refused you have return to Hong Kong. In the past you were given a fine too, but it seems now that refusal is free. You can’t simply walk back. You need to wait to your passport (can be 30 Minutes) and escorted to the Hong Kong side. In Hong Kong you will go through a more details customs check. That’s about it.

#### How about Australians? {#0110}

There is, or was, currently some confusion about Australians. The end of October 2016 information from the counter in Luohu was that Australians **can** get the 5-day-Shenzhen visa. But one couple was refused on Oct 11th 2016. Asking again on Nov. 8th 2016 reply was _Australians no problem!_ At this point it looks like Australians can again get the 5 Day Shenzhen Visa. This can of course change tomorrow again.

#### How about Americans? (USA passport holders) {#0120}

Since late 2017 Americans (USA passport holders) can get the 5-Day-Shenzhen-Visa! But the cost is a steep RMB 956 – that is about US$ 150.

#### How about Philippine nationals which were in China before? {#0130}

There are some comments in the web from Philippine nationals that got the 5-day-Shenzhen visa because they had an old China visa in their passport. This might have been changed now and currently they can not get the 5-day-Shenzhen visa at the border.
